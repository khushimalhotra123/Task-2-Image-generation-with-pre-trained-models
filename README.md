```

## Models Included

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Trained to generate realistic images by pitting two neural networks against each other—a generator and a discriminator.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: A probabilistic approach to image generation that produces continuous and interpretable latent spaces.
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate images through a process of gradually denoising a random input.
